Ronald Berlin Architect, P.C. translates the aspirations of its clients into beautiful and practical works of architecture. Ron’s perspective, developed over the course of two decades of professional practice, derives from his lifelong involvement in painting and sculpture, his fascination with the culture and history of architectural form, and his abiding respect for nature as the underpinning of human life.

A man with optimistic convictions, ready humor, and a compulsion to draw, Ron is happiest with pencil in hand. RBA’s clients look to him to solve their architectural puzzles, and to seamlessly merge the pragmatic with the aesthetic.

RBA’s projects embrace a wide range of human experience, including a Park Avenue duplex apartment, an award-winning renovation of an historic Princeton residence; an organic foods café, a pleasure pavilion in the Polish countryside; an antiques shop; and a mountain house in New Hampshire.
